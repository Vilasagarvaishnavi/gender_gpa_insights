# gender_gpa_insights
This project is about finding which gender having more gpa.
The uncleaned data is taken from kaggle. Along with this data, I have also got a separate word file that contains values that should be placed into specific columns in the uncleaned data using excel formulas.
After cleaning the data, I have created a dashboard for visualization.
